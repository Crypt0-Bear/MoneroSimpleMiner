# MoneroSimpleMiner
Monero Simple Miner is an easy to use GUI front-end for Monero mining. The miner includes an easy to use UI which simplifies complex techical options into a gamified easy to follow RPG-esque options. Makes it easy for newcommers to help strenghten the network

This is a new project and is considered very new. If you are interested in contributing (artwork, design principles, code or general ideas) please feel free to DM me via twitter: @Crypt0_Bear

## Why?
I wanted to create a desktop UI that can help incentivize more decentralization of Monero mining. 
The point of the MoneroSimpleMiner isn’t to focus on the profit side of monero mining but to help the network become stronger and more decentralized.

## Description
I want to make a frontend GUI for xmrig. The whole idea is making it into a casual RPG game. The GUI should have a nice GUI and has a monero theme with monero chan and maybe some memes. I want to make it have rpg elements and I am not a huge gamer so I could use some help coming up with ideas on what some of the gamification could be.

Thoughts so far:

Have certain achievements that unlock the more you mine
The more hashes you give the more XP you get
When choosing pools, the smaller the pool is compared to the network the higher the XP multiplier is
Solo mining gives you way more XP
Exclusive unlocks based on achievements etc
Cool pixel art and animations while mining is happening. Sort of how some people have aquariums or could be a city-scape that grows as your mining grows
The game evolves as you level up
Makes payouts fun since it pays monero but also can be pointed at donations and those give more XP
Considered having reward tokens or nfts as rewards in game but don’t like the privacy problems that could bring (Such as targeting all token holders as monero enthusiasts)
I could create a website that would track leaderboards and those would be provable by signing a message with address to login etc
What are the community's thoughts? Any ideas on how to make the gamification better? Any names for the program? I was thinking pixel art

I plan on making the UI elements using html and pywebkit then connecting them in a similar way to https://github.com/jwinterm/WowneroSpelunker I am choosing html since there are some open source game libraries that should be pretty easy to work with (I’ve done some of that ages ago). With html it is a bit easier to make the UI cross platform and seperate the UI “game” from the rest of the program.
